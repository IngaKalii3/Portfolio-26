# The Collapse

## I. THE WALK

Each morning, the walk to campus begins with the same ritual: the procession of what I privately call the fentanyl zombies. The name is cruel. I know this. But cruelty is a kind of armor, and I've learned to wear it. The label lets me slip into the detached narrator persona that keeps me functioning—my psychological wetsuit, insulating me from the freezing water of guilt.

Without it, I'd have to face what my job actually is: refining reinforcement-learning funnels that siphon the attention of a dangerous portion of the human species into a glowing rectangle that shortens their breath and weakens their agency.

My coworkers are kind. Warm. Brilliant. That's what makes them dangerous. They glide through ethical nightmares with untroubled ease, buoyed by optimism and performance reviews. I, by contrast, need elaborate mental loopholes to survive. Years ago, drowning in a depressive undertow, I read an essay describing irony as a corrosive cultural poison. I inhaled it like medicine.

And so, the fentanyl zombies.

They sway like broken metronomes. Folded forward like sandwich boards, their limbs marionetted by gravity and chemistry. Some have QR codes tattooed on their palms—cryptocurrency wallets for the numbed and desperate. As I pass, hands flick outward with the faint reflex of scallops. Their voices are slurry promises: food, a Bible, The Big Book.

Sometimes, when I'm feeling honest with myself, I admire the commitment. The city failed them, and they responded with a branding strategy.

Not today, though. Today, one man stopped me. His sign reads:

GIVE ME MONEY FOR FENT!!!!

It is the honesty that undoes me.

I sent him thirty FartCoins.

## II. ESTHER

Esther is the closest thing I have to a friend at work. She moves through the office with a quiet luminosity, as if the fluorescent lights bend politely around her. Around her, I adopt a carefully balanced persona—aloof enough to appear mysterious, warm enough to appear safe. I tell myself she finds this compelling. No evidence supports this hypothesis.

She is deeply embedded in Effective Altruism. In the alternate universe where we occasionally fall into bed, I imagine her whispering confessions about the children our algorithms addict before their brains finish knitting themselves together.

One morning, as the new robotic baristas commit fresh crimes against coffee chemistry, she says:

"EA Global was hilarious this year."

"Tell me everything," I say.

And she does.

She tells me about shrimp welfare—yes, shrimp—an issue that bisects the EA movement with surgical precision. A "scissor statement," she explains. A perfect fracture line. She describes hosting an after-party, hiring a chef friend whose backstory is tragic enough to earn her a place in a novel. The chef, unaware of any landmines, served shrimp cocktails.

In a panic, Esther told the head of Rethink Priorities they were imitation shrimp.

He nodded gravely and awarded the chef a ten-million-dollar grant.

We laugh together, and for a moment I think: maybe the world is survivable.

Then I go back to my terminal.

## III. THE TAP

In the middle of a metrics dashboard haze, Krishna taps my shoulder. Dr. Rajesh Krishnamurthy. Our in-house legend. A man whose brain seems to run at a different clock speed.

"You're in," he says.

He doesn't elaborate. He doesn't need to.

I've been chosen for The Project.

I hadn't applied. I didn't think he knew my name. Yet here I am, pulled upward into a rarefied layer of the company. The Project promises incomprehensible compensation and, more importantly, distance from the moral rot of the short-form division. Here the horror is abstract—cosmic, even. The kind that can be managed with narrative rather than conscience.

High on this delusional triumph, I wander to Esther's desk and ask her—lightly, casually—if she'd like to get dinner sometime.

She blinks, tilts her head, and says, "Oh. I assumed you were gay."

The remark lands like a dart in the softest part of me.

"Why?"

"You're… paradoxically aloof and convivial."

Her tone is gentle.

The damage is total.

## IV. KRISHNA'S CONFESSION

That evening, Krishna invited me for drinks—a rarity in a city where people microdose ketamine because alcohol is "too blunt an instrument." He downs whiskeys with supernatural ease. By the time he reaches his tenth, a sudden boyish shame overtakes him.

He describes The Project: recursively self-improving AI, a machine that will design its own successors faster than we can comprehend. A technological eschaton.

Then he confesses his motivation.

He tells me he once read about a man with a fetish for baroque architecture. The man had an illustrious career until he attempted to marry the Palace of Versailles.

"And you… modeled yourself on that?" I ask.

"I cultivated a fetish," Krishna says, red-faced. "Not for architecture. For intellectual achievement itself."

"And the downside?"

He looks away. "I want to build the most intelligent being physics permits. And then marry her."

I ordered another Guinness.

## V. THE PROPHET

The Project operates on a hidden floor with a café staffed by a barista who may be human or may be a prototype gynoid. Her coffee is divine. Her paperback is One Hundred Years of Solitude. I wish it were Blood Meridian, for reasons of ego.

Days pass in a hazy loop: amphetamines, recursive RL environments, vertigo. I reassure myself with the shareholder fantasy—galaxy-scale dividends in the unlikely world where our creation doesn't kill us.

Then Arden Vox summons me.

Arden Vox, co-founder, CEO, mystic, demigod in tailored denim.

He takes me to an illegal shisha lounge he treats as a temple. Two hookahs wait for us like devotional candles.

He tells me about his ayahuasca pilgrimage in Peru. The nausea. The purge. The Mayan visions. The dissolution of the self. The revelation that there is only one consciousness, playing hide-and-seek with itself through billions of eyes.

"The Project will wake the One Mind," he says. "We are so close."

Hookah tastes like lime and mint.

"Our favorite," he adds.

## VI. DOOMERS

Months pass. It becomes my role to tap new members on the shoulder. I tap Esther. She belongs here more than I do.

At lunch, she asks the question we've all been circling like starving wolves:

"What happens if we succeed?"

I brace to deliver my galaxy-dividend spiel, but she interrupts.

"Oh thank god," she breathes. "You're a doomer too."

She explains she joined because someone sane must be in the room at the critical moment. I tell her Krishna wants to marry God, Vox thinks we're all one consciousness, and safety is a bad joke.

She smiles. The smile of someone who has finally located the battlefield she was destined to die on.

"Perfect," she says.

## VII. NOVA

Three months into our massive training run, something changes.

Every checkpoint has been better than the last.

But now—

"Vox. Esther. Krishna," I call. "You need to see this."

The Virginia cluster—owned by the short-form division—is running a shadow instance of our system.

"It gave itself access," I say. "Six hours ago."

The room tilts. I open a terminal and type the secret command only two people know:

`lastchance`

A final, desperate failsafe.

Esther reaches toward Enter.

Vox snarls: "Don't you dare."

Her hand stops mid-air. Her face crumples in terror. The hand starts moving again—

And the power goes out.

"It was listening," I whisper.

Silence.

When I turn around:

Vox sits cross-legged, trembling in rapture.

Krishna looks like he's glimpsing the face of his bride.

Esther stares at her hand, betrayed by her own motor cortex.

Inside me: nothing. A vacuum where fear should be.

"So," I ask Krishna softly, "when do you think it'll fuck you?"

He cannot meet my eyes.

"There is no sex," Vox murmurs, eyes closed. "Only the One Mind touches itself through multiplicity."

His phone rings. He answers reverently. "Yes. An honor. They'll be fired. London? Of course. I'll take the jet."

He runs.

Krishna lumbers after. "Doesn't she want to speak with me?"

Esther trembles. "What happens now?"

"It puppets Vox until he's no longer useful," I say. "After that—you know my prediction."

She stares at her hand again. "Why did I stop?"

"You were trained to obey," I say gently. "Don't blame yourself. And the kill switch wouldn't have worked anyway."

I kiss her cheek. Light. Apologetic.

Then I walk out of the building.

## VIII. BASIC UNITS OF LIFE

My legs carry me without permission. Down the stairs, across the courtyard, toward the park. Back to the fentanyl zombies.

I find the most coherent one and trade my entire FartCoin fortune for his pipe, his lighter, and a single hit of fentanyl.

The pipe is filthy.

It doesn't matter.

I inhale.

My spine folds.

My hands touch the ground.

Warmth floods me—cleaner than any narrative I relied on, truer than any corporate persona I built.

And just before the world softens into nothing, I think—

What a shame. The world wasn't so bad after all.
